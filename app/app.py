Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint for document verification
@app.route('/verify_documents', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.json

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'proof_of_income' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'All required documents are not provided'}), 400
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = verify_identification(data['identification'])
    proof_of_income = verify_proof_of_income(data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history = verify_credit_history(data['credit_history'])
    employment_details = verify_employment_details(data['employment_details'])
    
    # Assess eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
    
    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)
    
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)
    
    return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200

# Function to verify identification document
def verify_identification(identification):
    # Verification logic goes here
    return True

# Function to verify proof of income document
def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Verification logic goes here
    return True

# Function to verify credit history document
def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Verification logic goes here
    return True

# Function to verify employment details document
def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Verification logic goes here
    return True

# Function to assess eligibility based on the verified documents
def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Eligibility assessment logic goes here
    return 'Eligible' if identification and proof_of_income and credit_history and employment_details else 'Not Eligible'

# Function to generate eligibility report
def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Report generation logic goes here
    return {'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

# Function to notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
def notify_employee(report):
    # Notification logic goes here
    print('Eligibility Report:', report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a `/verify_documents` endpoint for the document verification process. It accepts a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. It then verifies each document, assesses the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status.
