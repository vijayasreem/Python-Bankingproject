Here's a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint for getting the checklist of required documents
@app.route('/documents/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_documents_checklist():
    checklist = {
        'identification': 'Valid identification document (e.g., passport, driver's license)',
        'proof_of_income': 'Proof of income document (e.g., payslips, tax returns)',
        'credit_history': 'Credit history report',
        'employment_details': 'Employment details (e.g., employment contract, payslips)'
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)

# Endpoint for uploading and reviewing identification documents
@app.route('/documents/identification', methods=['POST'])
def upload_identification_documents():
    # Code for uploading and reviewing the identification documents
    # Ensure the documents are valid and accurate
    # Return verification status as response
    return jsonify({'verification_status': 'Valid'})

# Endpoint for verifying proof of income
@app.route('/documents/proof_of_income', methods=['POST'])
def verify_proof_of_income():
    # Code for verifying the proof of income document
    # Ensure it meets the bank's requirements for loan eligibility
    # Return verification status as response
    return jsonify({'verification_status': 'Verified'})

# Endpoint for performing credit check
@app.route('/documents/credit_check', methods=['POST'])
def perform_credit_check():
    # Code for performing credit check on the applicant
    # Retrieve credit history and assess creditworthiness
    # Return credit check result as response
    return jsonify({'credit_check_result': 'Good'})

# Endpoint for validating employment details
@app.route('/documents/employment_details', methods=['POST'])
def validate_employment_details():
    # Code for validating the employment details
    # Ensure they meet the bank's criteria for loan eligibility
    # Return validation status as response
    return jsonify({'validation_status': 'Validated'})

# Endpoint for generating verification report
@app.route('/documents/verification_report', methods=['POST'])
def generate_verification_report():
    # Code for generating the verification report
    # Summarize the verification results and eligibility assessment
    # Return the report as response
    verification_report = {
        'verification_status': 'Verified',
        'eligibility_assessment': 'Eligible'
    }
    return jsonify(verification_report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Note: This code is just a skeleton to give you an idea of how to structure the Flask API for the given user story. You will need to implement the actual logic for each endpoint according to your specific requirements and data storage mechanisms.
