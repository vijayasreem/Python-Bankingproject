Sure! Here's an example of how you can implement a Python Flask API for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit-check', methods=['POST'])
def credit_check():
    # Get the applicant's credit score and financial history from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    credit_score = data.get('credit_score')
    financial_history = data.get('financial_history')

    # Perform credit check and pre-qualification logic
    if credit_score >= 700 and financial_history == 'good':
        loan_amount = 100000
        interest_rate_range = (3, 5)
        pre_qualification_result = 'Pre-qualified'
    elif credit_score >= 500 and financial_history == 'fair':
        loan_amount = 50000
        interest_rate_range = (6, 8)
        pre_qualification_result = 'Pre-qualified with conditions'
    else:
        loan_amount = 0
        interest_rate_range = None
        pre_qualification_result = 'Not pre-qualified'

    # Prepare the response
    response = {
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range,
        'pre_qualification_result': pre_qualification_result
    }

    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a Flask route `/credit-check` that accepts a POST request. Inside the route, we retrieve the applicant's credit score and financial history from the request JSON. Then, we perform the credit check and pre-qualification logic based on the acceptance criteria. Finally, we prepare a response JSON with the loan amount, interest rate range, and pre-qualification result, and return it using `jsonify`.

You can run this Flask API by saving the code in a file, for example, `app.py`, and executing `python app.py` in your terminal. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/credit-check`, and you can send a POST request with the applicant's credit score and financial history in the request body to get the pre-qualification results.
