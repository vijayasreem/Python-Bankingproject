Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get applicant's details from the request
    applicant = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in applicant]

    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing required documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents (dummy verification process)
    verification_status = verify_documents(applicant)

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents (dummy eligibility assessment)
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(verification_status)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(applicant, eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report)

def verify_documents(applicant):
    # Dummy verification process
    return {'identification': True, 'proof_of_income': True, 'credit_history': True, 'employment_details': True}

def assess_eligibility(verification_status):
    # Dummy eligibility assessment
    return 'Eligible' if all(verification_status.values()) else 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(applicant, eligibility_status):
    return {
        'applicant': applicant,
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status
    }

def notify_employee(report):
    # Dummy notification process
    print(f'Notification: Applicant is {report["eligibility_status"]} for the loan.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To test the API, you can use a tool like cURL or Postman to send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/loan_application` with the applicant's details in the request body. The API will respond with a JSON report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan.

Note: This code is a simplified example and does not include actual document verification or eligibility assessment logic. You will need to implement these functionalities according to your specific requirements.
