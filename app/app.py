Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'proof_of_income' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = verify_document(data['identification'])
    proof_of_income = verify_document(data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history = verify_document(data['credit_history'])
    employment_details = verify_document(data['employment_details'])

    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def verify_document(document):
    # Logic to verify the document
    # Example: Check if document is valid and accurate
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Logic to assess eligibility based on verified documents
    # Example: Check if all documents meet the eligibility criteria
    return True

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Logic to generate eligibility report
    # Example: Create a report indicating the eligibility status
    return 'Eligible' if eligibility_status else 'Not Eligible'

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Logic to notify the bank employee
    # Example: Send a notification email to the bank employee
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan/application` that accepts POST requests for verifying loan applications. The API checks if all the required documents (identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details) are provided, verifies each document, assesses the eligibility based on the verified documents, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status.

Please note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify and enhance the code based on your specific requirements and business logic.
