Here is an example of a Python Flask API code to implement the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def check_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's information from the request
    applicant = request.json
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if not all(key in applicant for key in ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = verify_document(applicant['identification'])
    proof_of_income = verify_document(applicant['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history = verify_document(applicant['credit_history'])
    employment_details = verify_document(applicant['employment_details'])
    
    # Check if all documents are verified successfully
    if not all([identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details]):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Documents verification failed'}), 400
    
    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility = assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
    
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility)
    
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)
    
    return jsonify(report), 200

def verify_document(document):
    # TODO: Implement document verification logic
    return True  # Placeholder for verification result

def assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement loan eligibility assessment logic
    return True  # Placeholder for eligibility assessment result

def generate_report(eligibility):
    # TODO: Implement report generation logic
    return {'eligibility': eligibility}  # Placeholder for report data

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # TODO: Implement notification logic
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Please note that this is a basic implementation and you will need to fill in the logic for document verification, loan eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification according to your specific requirements.
