Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the Bank's Credit Check and Pre-Qualification Process for Loan Applicants user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit_check', methods=['POST'])
def credit_check():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Perform credit check logic here
    credit_score = calculate_credit_score(data)
    financial_history = get_financial_history(data)

    # Pre-qualify the applicant based on credit score and financial history
    prequalification_result = prequalify_applicant(credit_score, financial_history)

    # Generate response
    response = {
        'credit_score': credit_score,
        'financial_history': financial_history,
        'prequalification_result': prequalification_result
    }

    return jsonify(response), 200

def calculate_credit_score(data):
    # Implement credit score calculation logic here
    return data['credit_score']

def get_financial_history(data):
    # Implement financial history retrieval logic here
    return data['financial_history']

def prequalify_applicant(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Implement pre-qualification logic here
    # Use credit_score and financial_history to determine loan amount and interest rate range
    # Return pre-qualification result as a string or any format you prefer
    return 'Pre-qualified for a loan amount of $X to $Y with an interest rate of Z% to W%'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API with a single `/credit_check` endpoint that accepts POST requests. The endpoint expects the loan applicant's data in the request body as a JSON object.

The `credit_check` function retrieves the credit score and financial history from the request data. It then calls the `calculate_credit_score` and `get_financial_history` functions to perform the credit check logic.

After obtaining the credit score and financial history, the `prequalify_applicant` function is called to pre-qualify the applicant based on these parameters. The result is then included in the response along with the credit score and financial history.

Finally, the response is returned as a JSON object with a status code of 200.

You can test this API by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/credit_check` with the loan applicant's data in the request body.

Note: The implementation of the credit check logic, financial history retrieval, and pre-qualification logic is not provided in this code snippet. You will need to implement these functions according to your own business requirements and data sources.
