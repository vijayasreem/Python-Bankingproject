Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's data from the request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in data]
    
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing required documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents (implementation details not shown)
    verification_result = verify_documents(data)

    # Assess eligibility based on the verified documents (implementation details not shown)
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(verification_result)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(data, verification_result, eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status (implementation details not shown)
    notify_bank_employee(data, eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, we define a Flask route `/loan/verification` that accepts a POST request for verifying the loan eligibility. The request should include the applicant's data, including their identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details.

The API first checks if all the required documents are provided. If any document is missing, it returns an error response with a message indicating the missing documents.

If all the required documents are provided, the API then verifies the documents, assesses the eligibility based on the verification result, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that the actual implementations of the document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification functions are not shown in this example. You will need to implement them according to your specific requirements and business logic.
