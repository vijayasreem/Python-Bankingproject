Sure! Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Mock database for storing applicant's documents
documents_db = {
    "identification": {
        "status": "pending",
        "details": ""
    },
    "proof_of_income": {
        "status": "pending",
        "details": ""
    },
    "credit_history": {
        "status": "pending",
        "details": ""
    },
    "employment_details": {
        "status": "pending",
        "details": ""
    }
}

@app.route('/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_checklist():
    # Return the required documents checklist
    checklist = {
        "documents": ["identification", "proof_of_income", "credit_history", "employment_details"]
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)

@app.route('/documents', methods=['POST'])
def submit_documents():
    # Update the status and details of each submitted document
    for document in request.json:
        if document in documents_db:
            documents_db[document]["status"] = "submitted"
            documents_db[document]["details"] = request.json[document]
    return jsonify({"message": "Documents submitted successfully"})

@app.route('/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    # Verify the authenticity and accuracy of each submitted document
    for document in request.json:
        if document in documents_db and documents_db[document]["status"] == "submitted":
            documents_db[document]["status"] = "verified"
    return jsonify({"message": "Documents verified successfully"})

@app.route('/eligibility', methods=['GET'])
def check_eligibility():
    # Check the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = "ineligible"
    if all(documents_db[document]["status"] == "verified" for document in documents_db):
        eligibility_status = "eligible"
    return jsonify({"eligibility_status": eligibility_status})

@app.route('/report', methods=['GET'])
def generate_report():
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    report = {}
    for document in documents_db:
        report[document] = documents_db[document]["status"]
    return jsonify(report)

@app.route('/notify', methods=['GET'])
def notify_employee():
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    eligibility_status = check_eligibility().json["eligibility_status"]
    if eligibility_status == "eligible":
        notification = "Applicant is eligible for the loan"
    else:
        notification = "Applicant is not eligible for the loan"
    return jsonify({"notification": notification})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Flask API with the following endpoints:

1. `/checklist` - GET endpoint that returns the required documents checklist.
2. `/documents` - POST endpoint that allows the applicant to submit their documents.
3. `/verify` - POST endpoint that verifies the authenticity and accuracy of the submitted documents.
4. `/eligibility` - GET endpoint that checks the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents.
5. `/report` - GET endpoint that generates a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan.
6. `/notify` - GET endpoint that notifies the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing.

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements and database structure.
