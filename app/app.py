Sure! Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/apply', methods=['POST'])
def apply_loan():
    # Parse request data
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Validate required fields
    if 'name' not in data or 'email' not in data or 'phone' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Name, email, and phone are required fields'}), 400
    
    # Perform validation on other fields
    
    # Save the loan application to the database
    
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application submitted successfully'}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This Flask API code provides a single endpoint `/apply` that accepts POST requests for submitting a car mortgage loan application. The API expects the request data to be in JSON format and validates the required fields (name, email, and phone). You can add additional validation logic and database operations as needed.

Please note that this is just a sample code and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements and environment.
