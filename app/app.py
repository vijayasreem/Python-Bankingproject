Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the loan application data from the request
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment
    identification_verified = verify_identification(loan_application['identification'])
    income_verified = verify_income(loan_application['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(loan_application['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(loan_application['employment_details'])

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
    is_eligible = True
    if not identification_verified or not income_verified or not credit_history_verified or not employment_details_verified:
        is_eligible = False

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = {
        'applicant_name': loan_application['applicant_name'],
        'loan_amount': loan_application['loan_amount'],
        'is_eligible': is_eligible
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report)

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification logic
    # Return True if identification is verified, False otherwise
    return True

def verify_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform income verification logic
    # Return True if income is verified, False otherwise
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification logic
    # Return True if credit history is verified, False otherwise
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification logic
    # Return True if employment details are verified, False otherwise
    return True

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Perform notification logic to notify bank employee
    # This can be an email, SMS, or any other form of notification
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this code, we have created a Flask API with a single route `/loan/verify` that accepts a POST request containing the loan application data. The API then performs document verification and eligibility assessment based on the provided data.

The verification functions `verify_identification`, `verify_income`, `verify_credit_history`, and `verify_employment_details` are placeholders for your actual verification logic. You can implement these functions according to your specific requirements.

The API generates a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status and then notifies the bank employee using the `notify_bank_employee` function. Again, the notification logic is a placeholder and should be implemented as per your preferred method of notification.

Please note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific needs.
