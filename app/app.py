Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Placeholder for the document verification process
def verify_documents(documents):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are verified successfully, False otherwise
    return True

# Placeholder for the loan eligibility assessment process
def assess_eligibility(documents):
    # Perform loan eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return True if the applicant is eligible for the loan, False otherwise
    return True

# API endpoint for the document verification and loan eligibility assessment process
@app.route('/loan/assessment', methods=['POST'])
def loan_assessment():
    data = request.get_json()
    documents = data['documents']

    # Verify the provided documents
    if verify_documents(documents):
        # Assess the loan eligibility based on the verified documents
        eligibility = assess_eligibility(documents)

        # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
        report = {
            'eligibility': eligibility,
            'message': 'Congratulations! You are eligible for the loan.' if eligibility else 'Sorry! You are not eligible for the loan.'
        }

        # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
        # Implement your notification logic here

        return jsonify(report), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Failed to verify documents.'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we have defined a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan/assessment` that accepts a POST request containing the applicant's documents. The `verify_documents` function performs the document verification logic, and the `assess_eligibility` function performs the loan eligibility assessment logic. The API returns a JSON response containing a report indicating the eligibility status of the applicant. You can implement the notification logic according to your requirements.
