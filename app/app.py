Sure! Here's an example of how you can implement a Flask API for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the loan application details from the request body
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Extract the required documents from the loan application
    identification = loan_application.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = loan_application.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = loan_application.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = loan_application.get('employment_details')

    # Verify the provided documents (assuming a simple verification process)
    documents_verified = True  # Placeholder logic, you would implement your own verification logic here

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility = 'Eligible' if documents_verified else 'Not Eligible'

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = {
        'identification': identification,
        'proof_of_income': proof_of_income,
        'credit_history': credit_history,
        'employment_details': employment_details,
        'eligibility': eligibility
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    # You can implement your own notification logic here (e.g., email, SMS, etc.)

    # Return the report as a JSON response
    return jsonify(report), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, we define a POST route `/loan-application` that accepts loan application details as a JSON payload. It then extracts the required documents and verifies them (using a placeholder logic). Based on the verification result, it assesses the applicant's eligibility and generates a report. Finally, it returns the report as a JSON response.

You can test this API by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/loan-application` with the loan application details in the request body.

Note: This is a simplified example and you would need to implement your own verification and notification logic as per your requirements.
