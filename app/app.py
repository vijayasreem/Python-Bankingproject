Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story for the Bank's Credit Check and Pre-Qualification Process for Loan Applicants:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/creditcheck', methods=['POST'])
def credit_check():
    # Get the applicant's credit score and financial history from the request data
    data = request.get_json()
    credit_score = data.get('credit_score')
    financial_history = data.get('financial_history')
    
    # Perform credit check and pre-qualification process
    loan_amount, interest_rate_range = process_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history)
    
    # Generate pre-qualification outcome message
    if loan_amount > 0:
        outcome_message = f"Congratulations! You are pre-qualified for a loan amount of ${loan_amount} at an interest rate range of {interest_rate_range}."
    else:
        outcome_message = "We are sorry, but you do not meet the creditworthiness criteria for a loan."
    
    # Return the pre-qualification outcome message
    return jsonify({'outcome_message': outcome_message})

def process_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Perform credit score evaluation and financial history assessment
    # Here, you can implement your own logic to evaluate the credit score and financial history.
    # Calculate the loan amount and interest rate range based on the evaluation.
    # For example, you can use conditional statements to determine the loan amount and interest rate range.
    loan_amount = 0
    interest_rate_range = "N/A"
    
    if credit_score >= 700 and financial_history == 'good':
        loan_amount = 50000
        interest_rate_range = "4-6%"
    elif credit_score >= 600 and financial_history == 'average':
        loan_amount = 25000
        interest_rate_range = "6-8%"
    elif credit_score >= 500 and financial_history == 'poor':
        loan_amount = 10000
        interest_rate_range = "8-10%"
    
    return loan_amount, interest_rate_range

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a Flask API with a single route `/creditcheck` that accepts POST requests. The route handles the credit check and pre-qualification process based on the provided credit score and financial history. The `process_credit_check` function represents the logic to evaluate the credit score and financial history and determine the loan amount and interest rate range. The outcome message is then returned as a JSON response.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to modify the code according to your specific requirements and data structure.
