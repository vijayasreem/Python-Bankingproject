Sure! Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    req_data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are present
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in req_data]
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Perform verification and assessment logic here
    identification_verified = verify_identification(req_data['identification'])
    income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(req_data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(req_data['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(req_data['employment_details'])

    # Assess eligibility based on verification results
    is_eligible = identification_verified and income_verified and credit_history_verified and employment_details_verified

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = {
        'identification_verified': identification_verified,
        'income_verified': income_verified,
        'credit_history_verified': credit_history_verified,
        'employment_details_verified': employment_details_verified,
        'is_eligible': is_eligible
    }

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(is_eligible)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification logic here
    # Return True if verification is successful, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform proof of income verification logic here
    # Return True if verification is successful, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification logic here
    # Return True if verification is successful, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification logic here
    # Return True if verification is successful, False otherwise
    pass

def notify_bank_employee(is_eligible):
    # Perform notification logic here
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that the verification logic for each document (e.g., identification, proof of income, credit history, employment details) needs to be implemented separately in the respective functions (`verify_identification`, `verify_proof_of_income`, `verify_credit_history`, `verify_employment_details`). Similarly, the notification logic for the bank employee also needs to be implemented in the `notify_bank_employee` function.

You can run this Flask API code by saving it to a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and running `python app.py` in the terminal. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/loan/verification` and will accept a POST request with the required documents in the request body as a JSON object. It will return a JSON response containing the verification results and eligibility status.
