Sure! Here's a basic implementation of a Python Flask API for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit-check', methods=['POST'])
def credit_check():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Perform credit check and evaluate credit score and financial history
    credit_score = evaluate_credit_score(data['applicant_id'])
    financial_history = evaluate_financial_history(data['applicant_id'])

    # Pre-qualify applicant for loan amount and interest rate range
    loan_amount, interest_rate_range = pre_qualify_applicant(credit_score, financial_history)

    # Prepare pre-qualification outcome response
    outcome = {
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range,
        'credit_score': credit_score,
        'financial_history': financial_history
    }

    return jsonify(outcome)

def evaluate_credit_score(applicant_id):
    # Implement credit score evaluation logic here
    # Return credit score value

def evaluate_financial_history(applicant_id):
    # Implement financial history evaluation logic here
    # Return financial history value

def pre_qualify_applicant(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Implement pre-qualification logic here
    # Calculate loan amount and interest rate range based on credit score and financial history
    # Return loan amount and interest rate range

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, the `/credit-check` endpoint is used to perform the credit check and pre-qualification process. The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing the `applicant_id` for identifying the loan applicant.

The `evaluate_credit_score` and `evaluate_financial_history` functions are placeholders for the actual logic to evaluate the credit score and financial history of the applicant. You should implement these functions according to your specific requirements.

The `pre_qualify_applicant` function is also a placeholder for the pre-qualification logic. Here, you should calculate and determine the loan amount and interest rate range based on the credit score and financial history. Again, implement this function based on your specific business rules.

Finally, the pre-qualification outcome is packaged into a JSON response and returned to the client.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual implementation logic. Also, don't forget to install the necessary Flask library (`pip install flask`) before running the code.
