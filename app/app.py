Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Store the loan applicants' data
applicants = []


@app.route('/documents', methods=['GET'])
def get_document_checklist():
    checklist = {
        'identification': 'Valid government-issued ID',
        'proof_of_income': 'Pay stubs or income tax returns',
        'credit_history': 'Credit report from a credit bureau',
        'employment_details': 'Employment verification letter'
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)


@app.route('/documents/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_documents():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Validate and process the uploaded documents
    identification_doc = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income_doc = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history_doc = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details_doc = data.get('employment_details')

    # Perform verification and eligibility assessment on the documents
    verification_status = {
        'identification': verify_identification(identification_doc),
        'proof_of_income': verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc),
        'credit_history': verify_credit_history(credit_history_doc),
        'employment_details': verify_employment_details(employment_details_doc)
    }

    # Determine overall eligibility based on verification status
    overall_eligibility = assess_eligibility(verification_status)

    # Store the verification results and eligibility assessment
    applicant = {
        'verification_status': verification_status,
        'overall_eligibility': overall_eligibility
    }
    applicants.append(applicant)

    return jsonify(applicant), 201


@app.route('/documents/report', methods=['GET'])
def get_verification_report():
    return jsonify(applicants)


def verify_identification(identification_doc):
    # Perform identification document verification logic
    if identification_doc:
        return 'Valid'
    else:
        return 'Invalid'


def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc):
    # Perform proof of income verification logic
    if proof_of_income_doc:
        return 'Verified'
    else:
        return 'Not provided'


def verify_credit_history(credit_history_doc):
    # Perform credit history verification logic
    if credit_history_doc:
        return 'Verified'
    else:
        return 'Not provided'


def verify_employment_details(employment_details_doc):
    # Perform employment details verification logic
    if employment_details_doc:
        return 'Verified'
    else:
        return 'Not provided'


def assess_eligibility(verification_status):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic based on verification status
    if all(value == 'Verified' for value in verification_status.values()):
        return 'Eligible'
    else:
        return 'Not eligible'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Flask API with the following endpoints:
- GET `/documents`: Returns a checklist of required documents for the loan application process.
- POST `/documents/upload`: Allows the bank employee to upload the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details for verification and eligibility assessment.
- GET `/documents/report`: Returns a report summarizing the verification results and eligibility assessment for each loan applicant.

The verification logic for each document type is implemented as separate functions (`verify_identification`, `verify_proof_of_income`, `verify_credit_history`, `verify_employment_details`). The `assess_eligibility` function determines the overall eligibility based on the verification status.

Please note that this code is just a starting point and may need to be customized further based on your specific requirements and data storage needs.
