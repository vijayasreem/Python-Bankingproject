Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Retrieve applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details
    identification = request.json.get('identification')
    income_proof = request.json.get('income_proof')
    credit_history = request.json.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.json.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment
    is_identification_verified = verify_identification(identification)
    is_income_proof_verified = verify_income_proof(income_proof)
    is_credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(credit_history)
    is_employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(employment_details)

    # Assess loan eligibility
    is_eligible = assess_loan_eligibility(is_identification_verified, is_income_proof_verified, is_credit_history_verified, is_employment_details_verified)

    # Generate eligibility report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(is_eligible)

    return jsonify(eligibility_report)

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Logic to verify identification document
    # Return True or False based on verification result
    pass

def verify_income_proof(income_proof):
    # Logic to verify proof of income document
    # Return True or False based on verification result
    pass

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Logic to verify credit history document
    # Return True or False based on verification result
    pass

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Logic to verify employment details document
    # Return True or False based on verification result
    pass

def assess_loan_eligibility(is_identification_verified, is_income_proof_verified, is_credit_history_verified, is_employment_details_verified):
    # Logic to assess loan eligibility based on verified documents
    # Return True or False based on eligibility assessment
    pass

def generate_eligibility_report(is_eligible):
    # Logic to generate eligibility report
    # Return a dictionary or JSON object containing the eligibility status
    pass

def notify_bank_employee(is_eligible):
    # Logic to notify bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single route `/loan/verification` that accepts a POST request with JSON data containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. The API then performs document verification, assesses the loan eligibility, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee. Finally, the eligibility report is returned as a JSON response.

Please note that the implementation of document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification logic is left empty in this code. You would need to fill in these functions with your specific business logic.

Additionally, you may need to install the Flask library if you haven't already. You can do this by running `pip install flask` in your command line.
