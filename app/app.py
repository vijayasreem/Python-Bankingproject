Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    loan_application = request.get_json()
    
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    
    if all(doc in loan_application for doc in required_documents):
        identification = loan_application['identification']
        proof_of_income = loan_application['proof_of_income']
        credit_history = loan_application['credit_history']
        employment_details = loan_application['employment_details']
        
        # Verify the documents and assess eligibility
        is_valid = verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(is_valid)
        
        # Generate the eligibility report
        report = generate_report(eligibility_status)
        
        # Notify the bank employee
        notify_employee(eligibility_status)
        
        return jsonify(report), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement document verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are valid, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(is_valid):
    # Implement eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return 'Eligible' or 'Not Eligible' based on document validity
    return 'Eligible' if is_valid else 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Implement report generation logic here
    # Return a dictionary containing the eligibility status
    return {'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Implement notification logic here
    # Send a notification to the bank employee with the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single POST endpoint `/loan/application` that expects a JSON payload containing the loan application details. The API then verifies the required documents, assesses the applicant's eligibility, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee.

Note that you'll need to implement the actual logic for document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification according to your specific requirements.
