Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    # Get the loan application data from the request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Verify the identification document
    identification_document = data.get('identification_document')
    identification_verification_result = verify_identification(identification_document)

    # Verify the proof of income document
    proof_of_income_document = data.get('proof_of_income_document')
    proof_of_income_verification_result = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_document)

    # Verify the credit history document
    credit_history_document = data.get('credit_history_document')
    credit_history_verification_result = verify_credit_history(credit_history_document)

    # Verify the employment details document
    employment_details_document = data.get('employment_details_document')
    employment_details_verification_result = verify_employment_details(employment_details_document)

    # Assess the eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(identification_verification_result, proof_of_income_verification_result, credit_history_verification_result, employment_details_verification_result)

    # Generate the eligibility report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({'eligibility_report': eligibility_report}), 200

def verify_identification(identification_document):
    # Implement the logic to verify the identification document
    # Return the verification result
    pass

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_document):
    # Implement the logic to verify the proof of income document
    # Return the verification result
    pass

def verify_credit_history(credit_history_document):
    # Implement the logic to verify the credit history document
    # Return the verification result
    pass

def verify_employment_details(employment_details_document):
    # Implement the logic to verify the employment details document
    # Return the verification result
    pass

def assess_loan_eligibility(identification_verification_result, proof_of_income_verification_result, credit_history_verification_result, employment_details_verification_result):
    # Implement the logic to assess the loan eligibility based on the verification results
    # Return the eligibility status
    pass

def generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status):
    # Implement the logic to generate the eligibility report
    # Return the eligibility report
    pass

def notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Implement the logic to notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that the code provided is just a template and you will need to implement the actual logic for document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification based on your specific requirements.
