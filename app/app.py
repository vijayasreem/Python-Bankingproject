Sure! Below is an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Get applicant's documents
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Verify documents
    documents_verified = verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

    # Assess eligibility
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(documents_verified)

    # Generate report
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Add your verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are verified successfully, otherwise False
    return True

def assess_eligibility(documents_verified):
    # Add your eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return 'Eligible' if the applicant is eligible for the loan, otherwise 'Not Eligible'
    return 'Eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Create a report dictionary with necessary details
    report = {
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
        'additional_information': 'Add any additional information you want to include in the report'
    }
    return report

def notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Add your notification logic here
    # Send a notification to the bank employee with the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask endpoint `/loan_application` that accepts a POST request with applicant's documents as JSON data. The code then verifies the provided documents, assesses the eligibility, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee based on the eligibility status. You can add your own logic in the respective functions to implement the document verification process according to your requirements.
