Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the loan application details from the request
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification
    required_documents = loan_application.get('required_documents')
    verified_documents = verify_documents(required_documents)

    # Assess loan eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(verified_documents)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)

    # Return the eligibility status as a response
    return jsonify({'eligibility_status': eligibility_status})

def verify_documents(documents):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    verified_documents = []

    for document in documents:
        # Verify the document's authenticity and accuracy
        verified_document = verify_document(document)
        verified_documents.append(verified_document)

    return verified_documents

def verify_document(document):
    # Document verification logic here
    return document  # Placeholder verification logic

def assess_loan_eligibility(documents):
    # Perform loan eligibility assessment logic here
    return True  # Placeholder eligibility assessment logic

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = f"Loan eligibility status: {'Eligible' if eligibility_status else 'Not Eligible'}"
    return report

def notify_employee(report):
    # Send a notification to the bank employee
    print(report)  # Placeholder notification logic

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is a basic example and you will need to customize it according to your specific requirements, such as adding database interactions, data validation, and error handling.
