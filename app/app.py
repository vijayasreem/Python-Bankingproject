Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Placeholder for storing loan applications
loan_applications = []

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def submit_loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Validate the request data
    if not validate_loan_application(data):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid loan application data'}), 400

    # Add the loan application to the list
    loan_applications.append(data)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application submitted successfully'}), 201

@app.route('/loan-application/<int:application_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_loan_application(application_id):
    # Find the loan application by ID
    application = next((app for app in loan_applications if app['id'] == application_id), None)

    if application is None:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application not found'}), 404

    return jsonify(application), 200

@app.route('/loan-application/<int:application_id>/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_application(application_id):
    # Find the loan application by ID
    application = next((app for app in loan_applications if app['id'] == application_id), None)

    if application is None:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application not found'}), 404

    # Verify the provided documents
    if not verify_documents(application['documents']):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Failed to verify documents'}), 400

    # Assess the eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(application)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(application, eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(application, eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application verified successfully', 'report': report}), 200

def validate_loan_application(data):
    # Validate the loan application data here
    # Implement your validation logic

    return True

def verify_documents(documents):
    # Verify the documents here
    # Implement your document verification logic

    return True

def assess_eligibility(application):
    # Assess the eligibility based on the verified documents here
    # Implement your eligibility assessment logic

    return 'Eligible'  # Or 'Not Eligible' depending on the assessment

def generate_report(application, eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status here
    # Implement your report generation logic

    report = {
        'application_id': application['id'],
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
        # Include any other relevant information in the report
    }

    return report

def notify_bank_employee(application, eligibility_status):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status here
    # Implement your notification logic

    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Please note that this is just a basic example and you would need to implement the actual validation, verification, assessment, report generation, and notification logic according to your specific requirements.
