Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details from the request
    identification = request.json.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = request.json.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = request.json.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.json.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment logic here
    # ...

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    report = {
        'identification': identification,
        'proof_of_income': proof_of_income,
        'credit_history': credit_history,
        'employment_details': employment_details,
        'eligibility_status': 'eligible'  # Replace with actual eligibility status
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    # ...

    return jsonify(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan/verification` which accepts a POST request containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. Inside the `verify_loan_eligibility` function, you can implement the document verification and eligibility assessment logic based on the acceptance criteria.

Please note that the code provided is just a starting point and you will need to implement the actual document verification and eligibility assessment logic based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you should handle error cases and add appropriate error handling and response codes to the API.
