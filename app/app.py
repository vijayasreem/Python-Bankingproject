Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/prequalification', methods=['POST'])
def prequalification():
    # Get applicant's credit score and financial history from the request
    credit_score = request.json['credit_score']
    financial_history = request.json['financial_history']

    # Evaluate creditworthiness and determine loan amount and interest rate range
    loan_amount = calculate_loan_amount(credit_score, financial_history)
    interest_rate_range = calculate_interest_rate_range(credit_score, financial_history)

    # Construct pre-qualification response
    response = {
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range,
        'message': generate_prequalification_message(loan_amount, interest_rate_range)
    }

    return jsonify(response)

def calculate_loan_amount(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Perform credit check and calculate loan amount based on credit score and financial history
    # Replace this with your actual logic
    return 10000

def calculate_interest_rate_range(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Determine interest rate range based on credit score and financial history
    # Replace this with your actual logic
    return {'min': 5.0, 'max': 10.0}

def generate_prequalification_message(loan_amount, interest_rate_range):
    # Generate a clear and understandable explanation of the pre-qualification outcome
    return f'Congratulations! You are pre-qualified for a loan amount of ${loan_amount} with an interest rate range of {interest_rate_range["min"]}% - {interest_rate_range["max"]}%.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a Flask API endpoint `/prequalification` that expects a POST request containing the applicant's credit score and financial history in the request body. It then evaluates the creditworthiness of the applicant and determines the loan amount and interest rate range for pre-qualification. Finally, it constructs a response containing the loan amount, interest rate range, and a clear explanation of the pre-qualification outcome.

Note: This code provides a basic framework for implementing the given user story. You will need to replace the placeholder logic in the `calculate_loan_amount` and `calculate_interest_rate_range` functions with your actual credit check and pre-qualification algorithms.
