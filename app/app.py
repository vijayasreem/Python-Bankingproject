Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def assess_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's documents from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')
    
    # Perform document verification
    is_identification_valid = verify_identification(identification)
    is_proof_of_income_valid = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income)
    is_credit_history_valid = verify_credit_history(credit_history)
    is_employment_details_valid = verify_employment_details(employment_details)
    
    # Assess loan eligibility based on verified documents
    is_eligible = assess_eligibility(is_identification_valid, is_proof_of_income_valid, is_credit_history_valid, is_employment_details_valid)
    
    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)
    
    # Notify bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)
    
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan eligibility assessment completed.'})

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Implementation for verifying identification document
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Implementation for verifying proof of income document
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Implementation for verifying credit history document
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Implementation for verifying employment details document
    return True

def assess_eligibility(is_identification_valid, is_proof_of_income_valid, is_credit_history_valid, is_employment_details_valid):
    # Implementation for assessing loan eligibility based on verified documents
    return True

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Implementation for generating eligibility report
    return 'Eligible' if is_eligible else 'Not Eligible'

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Implementation for notifying bank employee
    print(f"Loan eligibility status: {report}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To use this Flask API, you can send a POST request to the `/loan-eligibility` endpoint with the applicant's documents in the request body. The API will perform document verification, assess the eligibility, generate a report, and notify the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that the implementation of the `verify_` and `assess_` functions are not provided in the code. You will need to implement these functions according to your specific requirements and logic.
