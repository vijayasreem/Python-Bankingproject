Here is a sample implementation of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details from the request
    identification = request.json.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = request.json.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = request.json.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.json.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment logic
    # ...

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = {
        'identification': identification,
        'proof_of_income': proof_of_income,
        'credit_history': credit_history,
        'employment_details': employment_details,
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    # ...

    return jsonify(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask route `/loan/verification` which accepts a POST request. The applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details are obtained from the request JSON payload. You would need to implement the logic for document verification and eligibility assessment based on the acceptance criteria.

Once the eligibility status is determined, a report is generated containing the applicant's details and eligibility status. You would also need to implement the logic for notifying the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing.

Note that this is a basic skeleton code and you would need to fill in the actual logic for document verification, eligibility assessment, and notification as per your specific requirements.
