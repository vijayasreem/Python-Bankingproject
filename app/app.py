Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given User story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint to provide a checklist of required documents
@app.route('/loan/documents', methods=['GET'])
def get_required_documents():
    required_documents = [
        'Identification',
        'Proof of Income',
        'Credit History',
        'Employment Details'
    ]
    return jsonify({'required_documents': required_documents})

# Endpoint to review and verify the provided documents
@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.get_json()
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification logic here

    return jsonify({'verification_status': 'Documents verified successfully'})

# Endpoint to assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
@app.route('/loan/eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def assess_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()
    eligibility = True  # Placeholder logic to assess eligibility based on verified documents

    return jsonify({'eligibility': eligibility})

# Endpoint to generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/loan/report', methods=['POST'])
def generate_report():
    data = request.get_json()
    eligibility = data.get('eligibility')

    # Generate report logic here

    return jsonify({'report': 'Loan eligibility report generated successfully'})

# Endpoint to notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/loan/notify', methods=['POST'])
def notify_employee():
    data = request.get_json()
    eligibility_status = data.get('eligibility_status')

    # Notification logic here

    return jsonify({'notification': 'Bank employee notified successfully'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is just a basic example and you will need to implement the actual document verification logic, report generation logic, and notification logic according to your specific requirements.
