Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given User Story for the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's identification documents
    identification_docs = request.files.getlist('identification_docs')

    # Get proof of income document
    proof_of_income_doc = request.files.get('proof_of_income_doc')

    # Get applicant's credit history
    credit_history = request.form.get('credit_history')

    # Get applicant's employment details
    employment_details = request.form.get('employment_details')

    # Perform verification and eligibility assessment
    identification_verification_status = verify_identification_docs(identification_docs)
    income_verification_status = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc)
    credit_check_result = perform_credit_check(credit_history)
    employment_verification_status = validate_employment_details(employment_details)

    # Generate verification report
    verification_report = {
        'identification_verification_status': identification_verification_status,
        'income_verification_status': income_verification_status,
        'credit_check_result': credit_check_result,
        'employment_verification_status': employment_verification_status
    }

    # Return verification report
    return jsonify(verification_report)

def verify_identification_docs(identification_docs):
    # Implement logic to verify identification documents
    # Return verification status
    pass

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc):
    # Implement logic to verify proof of income
    # Return verification status
    pass

def perform_credit_check(credit_history):
    # Implement logic to perform credit check
    # Return credit check result
    pass

def validate_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Implement logic to validate employment details
    # Return verification status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
