Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story for the Bank's Document Verification Process:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details
    applicant_data = request.get_json()
    identification = applicant_data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = applicant_data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = applicant_data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = applicant_data.get('employment_details')
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if not identification or not proof_of_income or not credit_history or not employment_details:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400
    
    # Verify identification documents
    identification_valid = verify_identification(identification)
    
    # Verify proof of income
    proof_of_income_valid = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income)
    
    # Perform credit check
    credit_worthiness = perform_credit_check(credit_history)
    
    # Validate employment details
    employment_details_valid = validate_employment_details(employment_details)
    
    # Generate verification report
    verification_report = generate_verification_report(identification_valid, proof_of_income_valid, credit_worthiness, employment_details_valid)
    
    # Determine loan eligibility based on verification results
    if identification_valid and proof_of_income_valid and credit_worthiness >= 700 and employment_details_valid:
        eligibility = 'Eligible'
    else:
        eligibility = 'Not Eligible'
    
    # Generate eligibility assessment report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(eligibility)
    
    # Return verification and eligibility reports
    return jsonify({
        'verification_report': verification_report,
        'eligibility_report': eligibility_report
    })

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Logic to verify identification documents
    # Return True if valid, False otherwise
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Logic to verify proof of income
    # Return True if valid, False otherwise
    return True

def perform_credit_check(credit_history):
    # Logic to perform credit check and calculate creditworthiness
    # Return creditworthiness score
    return 750

def validate_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Logic to validate employment details
    # Return True if valid, False otherwise
    return True

def generate_verification_report(identification_valid, proof_of_income_valid, credit_worthiness, employment_details_valid):
    # Logic to generate verification report
    # Return verification report
    return {
        'identification_valid': identification_valid,
        'proof_of_income_valid': proof_of_income_valid,
        'credit_worthiness': credit_worthiness,
        'employment_details_valid': employment_details_valid
    }

def generate_eligibility_report(eligibility):
    # Logic to generate eligibility assessment report
    # Return eligibility assessment report
    return {
        'eligibility': eligibility
    }

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single POST endpoint `/loan/application` that accepts the loan application data as JSON. It then processes the loan application by verifying the required documents, performing checks, and generating verification and eligibility reports based on the acceptance criteria. The code includes placeholder functions for the verification and validation processes, which you can implement with your specific logic.

Note: This code is just an example and may require modifications based on your specific requirements and database interactions.
