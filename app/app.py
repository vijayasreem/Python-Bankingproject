Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the bank's credit check and pre-qualification process for loan applicants:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit-check', methods=['POST'])
def perform_credit_check():
    # Get applicant's credit score and financial history from the request
    credit_score = request.json['credit_score']
    financial_history = request.json['financial_history']

    # Perform credit check process
    credit_check_result = evaluate_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history)

    # Pre-qualify the applicant based on the credit check result
    prequalification_result = prequalify_applicant(credit_check_result)

    # Return the pre-qualification result as a response
    return jsonify(prequalification_result)

def evaluate_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Perform credit score evaluation and financial history analysis here
    # You can use any credit scoring and financial analysis algorithms or models

    # Dummy example: determine credit check result based on credit score only
    if credit_score >= 700:
        return 'Good'
    elif credit_score >= 600:
        return 'Fair'
    else:
        return 'Poor'

def prequalify_applicant(credit_check_result):
    # Determine loan amount and interest rate range based on credit check result
    if credit_check_result == 'Good':
        loan_amount = 100000
        interest_rate_range = (3, 5)
    elif credit_check_result == 'Fair':
        loan_amount = 50000
        interest_rate_range = (5, 8)
    else:
        loan_amount = 0
        interest_rate_range = (0, 0)

    # Prepare pre-qualification result
    prequalification_result = {
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range,
        'credit_check_result': credit_check_result
    }

    return prequalification_result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a Flask API with one route `/credit-check` which accepts POST requests. The API expects the applicant's credit score and financial history in the request payload.

The `perform_credit_check` function handles the credit check process. It calls the `evaluate_credit_check` function to evaluate the credit score and financial history. Then, it passes the credit check result to the `prequalify_applicant` function to determine the loan amount and interest rate range. Finally, it returns the pre-qualification result as a JSON response.

The `evaluate_credit_check` function is a dummy implementation that determines the credit check result based on the credit score only. You can replace this with your own credit scoring and financial analysis logic.

The `prequalify_applicant` function determines the loan amount and interest rate range based on the credit check result. It prepares the pre-qualification result as a dictionary.

To run this Flask API, you can save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run it using the command `python app.py`. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/credit-check`.

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not include any database or authentication functionalities. You may need to modify and enhance the code to fit your specific requirements.
