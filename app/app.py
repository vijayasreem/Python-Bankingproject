Sure! Here's an example of how you can implement a Python Flask API for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data to simulate document verification
documents = {
    "identification": False,
    "proof_of_income": False,
    "credit_history": False,
    "employment_details": False
}

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    # Get the loan application data from the request
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Verify the identification document
    if loan_application.get('identification_document'):
        documents['identification'] = True

    # Verify the proof of income document
    if loan_application.get('proof_of_income_document'):
        documents['proof_of_income'] = True

    # Verify the credit history document
    if loan_application.get('credit_history_document'):
        documents['credit_history'] = True

    # Verify the employment details document
    if loan_application.get('employment_details_document'):
        documents['employment_details'] = True

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    if all(documents.values()):
        eligibility_status = "Eligible for loan"
    else:
        eligibility_status = "Not eligible for loan"

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = {
        "applicant_name": loan_application.get('applicant_name'),
        "eligibility_status": eligibility_status
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    # You can add your own logic here to send a notification

    return jsonify(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan_application` that accepts a `POST` request with the loan application data. We verify the provided documents by updating the `documents` dictionary accordingly. Then, we assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents and generate a report indicating their eligibility status. Finally, we return the report as a JSON response.

You can test this API by sending a `POST` request to `http://localhost:5000/loan_application` with the loan application data in the request body. The API will respond with the eligibility report in JSON format.

Note: This is just a basic example to get you started. You might need to modify and enhance the code according to your specific requirements and data models.
