Here's a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'proof_of_income' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents
    identification_verified = verify_document(data['identification'])
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_document(data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_document(data['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_document(data['employment_details'])

    # Assess the eligibility based on the verified documents
    is_eligible = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def verify_document(document):
    # Logic to verify the document
    # Returns True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Logic to assess the eligibility based on the verified documents
    # Returns True if the applicant is eligible, False otherwise
    return True

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Logic to generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    # Returns the generated report
    return 'Eligible' if is_eligible else 'Not Eligible'

def notify_employee(report):
    # Logic to notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

You can run this code in a Python environment with Flask installed. The API endpoint for verifying loan eligibility is `/loan/verify` and it accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the required documents. The code verifies each document, assesses the eligibility, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee accordingly.
