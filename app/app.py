Sure! Below is an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get the loan application data from the request
    loan_application_data = request.get_json()

    # Verify the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details
    identification_verified = verify_identification(loan_application_data['identification'])
    income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(loan_application_data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(loan_application_data['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(loan_application_data['employment_details'])

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents
    eligible_for_loan = check_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    report = generate_report(eligible_for_loan)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # TODO: Implement identification verification logic
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # TODO: Implement proof of income verification logic
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # TODO: Implement credit history verification logic
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement employment details verification logic
    return True

def check_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # TODO: Implement loan eligibility assessment logic based on the verified documents
    return True

def generate_report(eligible_for_loan):
    # TODO: Implement report generation logic
    if eligible_for_loan:
        return "Applicant is eligible for the loan."
    else:
        return "Applicant is not eligible for the loan."

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # TODO: Implement notification logic to notify the bank employee
    print(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that the code provided is just an example and you will need to implement the verification and assessment logic based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you may need to modify the code to fit your database or notification system.
