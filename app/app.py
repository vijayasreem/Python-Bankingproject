Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment here
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if identification and proof_of_income and credit_history and employment_details:
        # Perform document verification logic here
        verification_status = verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

        # Assess the eligibility based on verified documents
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(verification_status)

        # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
        report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

        # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
        notify_employee(eligibility_status)

        return jsonify({'report': report}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'All required documents are not provided'}), 400

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    # Return the verification status
    return True

def assess_eligibility(verification_status):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return the eligibility status
    return 'Eligible' if verification_status else 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = {
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
    }
    return report

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    # You can send an email, message, or any other notification method here
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan_application` that accepts a POST request with the loan application data in JSON format. It then performs document verification and eligibility assessment based on the provided data, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that the code provided is a starting point, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the document verification and eligibility assessment logic you want to implement.
