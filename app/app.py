Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint to provide a checklist of required documents
@app.route('/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_checklist():
    checklist = [
        'Identification',
        'Proof of income',
        'Credit history',
        'Employment details'
    ]
    return {'checklist': checklist}

# Endpoint to review and verify the provided documents
@app.route('/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')
    
    # Perform verification logic here
    
    return {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Documents verified successfully'}

# Endpoint to assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
@app.route('/assess', methods=['POST'])
def assess_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    
    eligibility_status = True  # Placeholder value, replace with actual assessment
    
    return {'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

# Endpoint to generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/generate_report', methods=['POST'])
def generate_report():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    eligibility_status = data.get('eligibility_status')
    
    # Generate report logic here
    
    report = {
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
        'report': 'Sample report content'
    }
    
    return {'report': report}

# Endpoint to notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/notify', methods=['POST'])
def notify_employee():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    eligibility_status = data.get('eligibility_status')
    
    # Notification logic here
    
    message = f'Applicant eligibility status: {eligibility_status}'
    
    return {'message': message}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is just a sample code and you will need to implement the actual verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification logic according to your requirements.
