Sure! Here's an example of a Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the loan application details from the request
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Check if all the required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in loan_application or 'proof_of_income' not in loan_application or 'credit_history' not in loan_application or 'employment_details' not in loan_application:
        return {'error': 'Please provide all the required documents.'}, 400

    # Verify the identification document
    if not verify_document(loan_application['identification']):
        return {'error': 'Identification document verification failed.'}, 400

    # Verify the proof of income document
    if not verify_document(loan_application['proof_of_income']):
        return {'error': 'Proof of income document verification failed.'}, 400

    # Verify the credit history document
    if not verify_document(loan_application['credit_history']):
        return {'error': 'Credit history document verification failed.'}, 400

    # Verify the employment details document
    if not verify_document(loan_application['employment_details']):
        return {'error': 'Employment details document verification failed.'}, 400

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return {'report': report}, 200

def verify_document(document):
    # Implementation of document verification logic goes here
    # Return True if the document is verified successfully, else False
    pass

def assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application):
    # Implementation of loan eligibility assessment logic goes here
    # Return the eligibility status based on the verified documents
    pass

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Implementation of report generation logic goes here
    # Return a report indicating the eligibility status
    pass

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Implementation of notification logic goes here
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this code, we define a Flask API with a single route `/loan/application` that accepts a POST request. Inside the route function `verify_loan_eligibility()`, we perform the following tasks:

1. Check if all the required documents are provided in the loan application.
2. Verify each document using the `verify_document()` function.
3. Assess the loan applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents using the `assess_loan_eligibility()` function.
4. Generate a report indicating the eligibility status using the `generate_report()` function.
5. Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status using the `notify_bank_employee()` function.

You would need to fill in the implementation details for the `verify_document()`, `assess_loan_eligibility()`, `generate_report()`, and `notify_bank_employee()` functions based on your specific requirements.

Note: This is a basic example to demonstrate the Flask API structure for the given user story. You may need to modify and enhance it according to your specific needs.
