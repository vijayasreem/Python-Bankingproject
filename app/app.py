Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get the loan application details from the request
    application_data = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification and assessment
    identification_verified = verify_identification(application_data['identification'])
    income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(application_data['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(application_data['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(application_data['employment_details'])

    # Determine the eligibility status based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate the eligibility report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify(eligibility_report), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification process
    # Return True if identification is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform proof of income verification process
    # Return True if proof of income is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification process
    # Return True if credit history is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification process
    # Return True if employment details are verified, False otherwise
    pass

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Perform eligibility assessment based on the verified documents
    # Return the eligibility status (e.g., 'Eligible' or 'Not Eligible')
    pass

    # Generate the eligibility report based on the eligibility status
    # Return the eligibility report as a dictionary
    pass
