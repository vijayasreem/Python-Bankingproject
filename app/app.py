Here is an example of a Python Flask API code for the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Dummy data for document verification
documents = {
    "identification": False,
    "proof_of_income": False,
    "credit_history": False,
    "employment_details": False
}

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    applicant_documents = request.json

    # Verify identification document
    if applicant_documents.get('identification'):
        documents['identification'] = True
    
    # Verify proof of income document
    if applicant_documents.get('proof_of_income'):
        documents['proof_of_income'] = True
    
    # Verify credit history document
    if applicant_documents.get('credit_history'):
        documents['credit_history'] = True
    
    # Verify employment details document
    if applicant_documents.get('employment_details'):
        documents['employment_details'] = True
    
    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility()

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def assess_loan_eligibility():
    # Custom logic to assess loan eligibility based on verified documents
    if all(documents.values()):
        return "Eligible"
    else:
        return "Not Eligible"

def generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status):
    # Custom logic to generate eligibility report
    report = {
        "eligibility_status": eligibility_status
    }
    return report

def notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Custom logic to notify bank employee of eligibility status
    if eligibility_status == "Eligible":
        print("Applicant is eligible for further processing.")
    else:
        print("Applicant is not eligible for the loan.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is just a basic example to demonstrate the functionality. You will need to add your own custom logic and integrate it with a database or any other required systems for a complete implementation.
