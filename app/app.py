Sure! Here's a basic implementation of a Python Flask API for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit_check', methods=['POST'])
def perform_credit_check():
    # Assuming you have some credit check algorithm or service
    # You can replace this with your actual credit check implementation
    applicant_data = request.get_json()
    credit_score = calculate_credit_score(applicant_data)
    financial_history = get_financial_history(applicant_data)
    
    # Pre-qualify the applicant based on credit score and financial history
    loan_amount, interest_rate_range = pre_qualify(applicant_data, credit_score, financial_history)
    
    # Prepare the response
    response = {
        'credit_score': credit_score,
        'financial_history': financial_history,
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range
    }
    
    return jsonify(response)

def calculate_credit_score(applicant_data):
    # Perform credit score calculation logic here
    # Replace this with your actual credit score calculation implementation
    return 700

def get_financial_history(applicant_data):
    # Fetch and process financial history data here
    # Replace this with your actual implementation to retrieve applicant's financial history
    return {
        'debt': 50000,
        'income': 60000,
        'payment_history': 'Good'
    }

def pre_qualify(applicant_data, credit_score, financial_history):
    # Perform pre-qualification logic here based on credit score and financial history
    # Replace this with your actual pre-qualification implementation
    loan_amount = 0
    interest_rate_range = (0, 0)
    
    if credit_score >= 700 and financial_history['payment_history'] == 'Good':
        loan_amount = financial_history['income'] * 5
        interest_rate_range = (5, 10)
    
    return loan_amount, interest_rate_range

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this implementation, we have defined a single route `/credit_check` which accepts POST requests. The request should contain the applicant's data in the JSON format. The `perform_credit_check` function performs the credit check and pre-qualification process.

The `calculate_credit_score` function calculates the credit score based on the applicant's data. The `get_financial_history` function fetches and processes the applicant's financial history. The `pre_qualify` function determines the loan amount and interest rate range based on the credit score and financial history.

The response is prepared with the credit score, financial history, loan amount, and interest rate range. It is then returned as a JSON response.

You can modify the implementation according to your specific credit check and pre-qualification logic.
