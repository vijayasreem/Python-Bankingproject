Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given User Story for the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Placeholder data for demonstration purposes
required_documents = ['identification', 'proof of income', 'credit history', 'employment details']

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get applicant's documents from the request
    documents = request.json.get('documents')

    # Verify identification document
    identification_status = verify_identification(documents.get('identification'))

    # Verify proof of income document
    income_status = verify_proof_of_income(documents.get('proof of income'))

    # Perform credit check
    credit_status = perform_credit_check(documents.get('credit history'))

    # Verify employment details
    employment_status = verify_employment_details(documents.get('employment details'))

    # Calculate overall eligibility assessment
    eligibility = calculate_eligibility(identification_status, income_status, credit_status, employment_status)

    # Generate verification report
    report = generate_report(eligibility, identification_status, income_status, credit_status, employment_status)

    return jsonify(report)

def verify_identification(identification_document):
    # TODO: Implement identification document verification logic
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(income_document):
    # TODO: Implement proof of income verification logic
    return True

def perform_credit_check(credit_history):
    # TODO: Implement credit check logic
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement employment details verification logic
    return True

def calculate_eligibility(identification_status, income_status, credit_status, employment_status):
    # TODO: Implement eligibility calculation logic based on verification status
    return True

def generate_report(eligibility, identification_status, income_status, credit_status, employment_status):
    # TODO: Generate verification report based on verification status and eligibility
    report = {
        'eligibility': eligibility,
        'identification_status': identification_status,
        'income_status': income_status,
        'credit_status': credit_status,
        'employment_status': employment_status
    }
    return report

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and you will need to implement the actual verification logic based on your requirements. Additionally, you may need to integrate with external services or databases to perform credit checks or retrieve employment details.
